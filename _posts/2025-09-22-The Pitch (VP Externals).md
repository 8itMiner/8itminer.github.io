Hey there! I'm Sidharth, a second year student at UNSW pursuing studies in aerospace engineering and computer science, majoring in security engineering. I've been in SecSoc for two years now, firstly as a member of the Careers and Partnerships subcommittee in 2024, then as a member of the Conferences subcommittee in 2025.

For more info, please have a look at the [about me](../About-Me-(Start-here!)) page.

# Why am I running for Vice President of Externals? 
We do a lot of great work promoting security education within the uni, and I think we're fairly well known for this within the uni - I think it's time SecSoc strengthens our recognition and ties to industry as well! Specifically, my own experience in the partnerships subcom has highlighted that we sometimes have trouble keeping up with our obligations in relation to events owed to sponsors, especially when these obligations roll over and pile up over subsequent years. Often these are because it's difficult to find times when sponsors are willing to come in and do events or because sponsors (understandably) take some time to reply to our emails, but I think its worth having a conversation about how we approach pitching to potential sponsors to avoid ending up in the unenviable situation of overpromising and being forced to underdeliver.

## Experience
Having been a member of both our Careers & Partnerships subcom as well as our Conferences subcom, I've been fortunate to have a lot of experience working with our sponsors - I've organised workshops and facilitated industry/academia panels as both an independent event and at SCONES, among other things. This has given me a deep understanding of what our sponsors are looking for, what their sponsorship timelines are, and how we can work with industry to ensure our sponsorship relationship is fruitful for the wider security community at UNSW. I believe this positions me to, as the Externals VP, successfully coordinate our relationships with industry, research organisations, professional bodies, and government, to put SecSoc on the map.

## Vision
* Work with exec and partnerships directors to revamp our approach to pitching to sponsors, so we maximise our capacity to build positive relationships with companies. This reduces the annual workload of having to find new sponsors every year, while also reducing stress for our external facing subcommittees (CTF/Projects/Careers/Conferences) by setting a more realistic sponsor event delivery workload.
* Widen the range of external entities we engage with to research organisations, professional bodies or industry groups, and government, by building a model for one off partnerships for specific events. This allows for easier buy in to SecSoc events for industry, facilitating greater access to industry for security students and improving the value we create for the UNSW security community.
