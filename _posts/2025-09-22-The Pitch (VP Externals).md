Hey there! I'm Sidharth, a second year student at UNSW pursuing studies in aerospace engineering and computer science, majoring in security engineering. I've been in SecSoc for two years now, firstly as a member of the Careers and Partnerships subcommittee in 2024, then as a member of the Conferences subcommittee in 2025.

For more info, please have a look at the [about me](../About-Me-(Start-here!)) page.
