# whoami
Hey there! I'm Sidharth, a second year student at UNSW pursuing studies in aerospace engineering and computer science, majoring in security engineering. I've been in SecSoc for two years now, firstly as a member of the Careers and Partnerships subcommittee in 2024, then as a member of the Conferences subcommittee in 2025.

For more info, please have a look at the [about me](../About-Me-(Start-here!)) page.

# Why am I running for Treasurer?
I want to build on the success of previous exec teams + partnerships subcoms to put the society in a stronger financial situation going forwards! Specifically, my own experience in the partnerships subcom has highlighted that we sometimes have trouble keeping up with our obligations in relation to events owed to sponsors, especially when these obligations roll over and pile up over subsequent years. Often these are because it's difficult to find times when sponsors are willing to come in and do events or because sponsors (understandably) take some time to reply to our emails, but I think its worth having a conversation about how we approach pitching to potential sponsors to avoid ending up in the unenviable situation of overpromising and being forced to underdeliver.

## A note on the role of Treasurer
In case you're not aware, there is a proposed constitutional amendment to merge the positions of Arc Delegate and Treasurer. I think this is a bad idea, since, having personally dealt with the hoops clubs have to jump through in order to maintain good standing with Arc, I know that this is an extremely large workload - IMO, too much for one person to handle on top of also handling the club's finances. I've assumed this amendment will pass, but have split up the following section, on why you should vote for me, into two parts to address both aspects of the role, just in case the amendment does not pass.

## Experience

### Re: Arc Delegate responsibilities
As I mentioned above, I've had some experience dealing with Arc as part of my term as VP Internals at UNSW Debating Society. I'm one of the few people with access to UNSW Room Management's internal room booking system - but if that isn't enough to get your vote, I also have deep understanding of all the hoops we need to jump through to remain in good standing with Arc (I'VE PLAYED THESE GAMES BEFORE), and the more Arc likes us, the more money we get :) 

### Re: Treasurer responsibilities
As a previous member of both the Partnerships subcom _and_ the Conferences subcom, I had a deep knowledge of how the society gets its money and how we spend (most) of our money. I think this positions me to make smart decisions around society expenditure, gives me an intution on where we need to be careful with regards to our auditing requirements, and enables me to plan adequately to ensure te society is financially healthy!

I also have experience managing some part of a large amount of society finances through my experience as the Vice President of Internals at the UNSW Debating Society, where I took the initiative to apply for a variety of Arc grants to successfully bring our weekly meetings and Rege socials from a net loss to the society to a net gain. I hope to bring this experience to SecSoc to expand the range of events we are able to offer to our members, strengthening our strong spirit of community even frther!

## Vision
* Work with exec and partnerships directors to revamp our approach to pitching to sponsors, so we maximise our capacity to build positive relationships with companies. This reduces the annual workload of having to find new sponsors every year, while reducing stress for the Careers and Partnerships subcommittee.
* Leverage my experience working with Arc Clubs in order to expand the range of Arc grants we apply for, making events more self-sufficient in terms of funding beyond relying on the attendance grant, which Arc is actively trying to reduce. This protects the society from an overreliance on a single funding source in the short term and expands our capacity to run more events for members!
