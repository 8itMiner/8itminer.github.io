# whoami

Hey there! I'm Sidharth, a second year student at UNSW pursuing studies in aerospace engineering and computer science, majoring in security engineering. I've been in SecSoc for two years now, firstly as a member of the Careers and Partnerships subcommittee in 2024, then as a member of the Conferences subcommittee in 2025. 

# Experience

Having been involved in both our largest fundraising process (finding sponsors) and our largest point of expenditure (SCONES), I've gained a pretty good understanding of what it takes to keep the society afloat, and how to work with sponsors to ensure we build a relationship that is productive for our members. I've also been fortunate to interact with almost all of the other people and subcommittees that make up the society, whether it is to plan and release marketing for an event with one of our partners, or to see how the CTFs for SCONES are going. I'm confident that my understanding of how the society works, our goals, and how we can achieve them makes me a great candidate to lead the society as an exec in 2026.

I've also done a bunch of other stuff that's less interesting than SecSoc :(... I'm just finishing up my term as the Vice President of Internals at the UNSW Debating Society, which has been a mixed bag - one one hand, I've had to deal with Arc bureacracy for a whole year, which I've (against my will) become something of an expert in after a year of navigating their room booking system, applying for almost every grant type they offer, and dealing with the brunt of the weekly admin work to keep the society alive and functional. The upside of this has been watching the society break attendance records for our major events like show debates and major competitions (we're sending our largest ever contingent to the world championships this year!), a product of the culture I feel I've developed through my management of our internal events.
